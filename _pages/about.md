I am a Security Tester with over 6 years of experience. My past projects include Penetration Testing (Black Box, Grey Box, White Box) for Web Applications, Infrastructure (Cloud/On-premises), Security Assessments, Mobile (iOS and Android). In addition, I am able to perform vulnerability assessments and source code security review service. I have a strong knowledge of OWASP Top 10. It includes vulnerabilities, their description, impact, mitigation and etc. I am always working towards updating my skills and keeping up with the industry. This is why I have recently passed OSWE course from Offensive Security. So far, I love the experience. I have passed few certificates: OSWA, OSWE, OSCP, eWPTXv2, eJPT, Cloud Digital Leader, Microsoft Certified: Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900) and eCPPTv2.
