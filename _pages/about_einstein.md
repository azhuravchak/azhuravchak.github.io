I am a Security Tester with over 6 years of experience. My past projects include Penetration Testing (Black Box, Grey Box, White Box) for Web Applications, Infrastructure (Cloud/On-premises), Security Assessments, Mobile (iOS and Android). In addition, I am able to perform vulnerability assessments and source code security review service. I have a strong knowledge of OWASP Top 10. It includes vulnerabilities, their description, impact, mitigation and etc. I am always working towards updating my skills and keeping up with the industry. This is why I have recently passed OSWE course from Offensive Security. So far, I love the experience. I have passed few certificates: OSWA, OSWE, OSCP, eWPTXv2, eJPT, Cloud Digital Leader, Microsoft Certified: Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900) and eCPPTv2.![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ecd2817a-df97-42a5-8a9e-57e45ef528e4)

You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
